# dotfiles

Portable configurations for my computing setup.

I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) and [swaywm](https://swaywm.org/).

## Usage

Dotfiles (except folders inside `_apps`) are managed with [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

```shell
$ stow zsh
```

You can use `stow -D` to uninstall dotfile packages, too.
